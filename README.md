## Abstract

In today’s world, prospective students spend a considerable amount of time researching universities to find the best fit for their academic and career aspirations. To streamline this process, we propose CRBench (College Recommender
Benchmark), which employs machine learning techniques to predict the most suitable universities for students based on their personal and academic profiles. Utilizing a dataset with 29 features, we apply a variety of regression and advanced machine learning models—including Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression for baseline predictions, and more sophisticated approaches such as XGBoost,
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks, Random Forest and a Feature Token Transformer to forecast potential income and perform cluster analysis. Also, we use data imputation to increase our dataset size and compare different methods that affect model distinct accuracy.
