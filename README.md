# College-recommender-with-big-data



In today’s world, prospective students spend a considerable amount of time re-
searching universities to find the best fit for their academic and career aspira-
tions. To streamline this process, we propose CRBench (College Recommender
Benchmark), which employs machine learning techniques to predict the most
suitable universities for students based on their personal and academic profiles.
Utilizing a dataset with 29 features, we apply a variety of regression and ad-
vanced machine learning models—including Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression
for baseline predictions, and more sophisticated approaches such as XGBoost,
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks, Random Forest and a Feature
Token Transformer to forecast potential income and perform cluster analysis. Also,
we use data imputation to increase our dataset size and compare different meth-
ods that affect model distinct accuracy.
